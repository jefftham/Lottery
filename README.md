##Purpose
- This is a person project/portfolio/repository for the [author](https://github.com/jefftham/) to show and prove his knowlegde in JavaScript, NodeJS, ExpressJs, Websocket, jQuery, & etc. 

##Reasons
- For your information, the [author](https://github.com/jefftham/) does not have special interest in lottery. The reason of picking lottery as a personal project is that the [author](https://github.com/jefftham/) plan to implement dynamic routing by user's IP address in this [project](https://github.com/jefftham/Lottery). For example, the main page will display Virginia Lottery Result if the user's IP address is in Virginia.
- Since Lottery Results are updating frequently, it is a good challenge to parse/scrape the official websites and display the latest results.
